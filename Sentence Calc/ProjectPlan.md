1 Introduction


The purpose of this software is to count the average number of words per sentence in a file containing an essay. It will be used by students and teachers.


2 Process Description


1. Requirements gathering - Establish the needs of the stakeholders (teacher and students) for the software system. 
 - Entrance Criteria: Requirements specification
 - Exit Criteria: product requirements document.
2. Design - Analyzing the collected requirements (we are not going to do this phase because of the simplicity of this project).
 - Entrance Criteria: Normally the collected requirements.
 - Exit Criteria: Normally a software architecture design document.
3. Implementation - Implementing the requirements into a software program
 - Entrance Criteria: Analyzed Requirements
 - Exit Criteria: Completed software program
4. Verification - Testing the software program to make sure that it is without major problems.
 - Entrance Criteria: Software program and test cases.
 - Exit Criteria: Tested software program.
5. Maintenance - Correcting problems that found by the stakeholders and adding new features.
 - Entrance Criteria: The software program.
 - Exit Criteria: A fixed and/or enhanced software program.


3 Team


Project Manager - Organizes and plans the project activities. Ensures final deliverables are complete. Assists leads in removing roadblocks.
